Healthcare Management System (HMS) Database
-------------------------------------------

Project Overview 
----------------

--> This project is a standalone, MySQL-only database solution for a Healthcare Management System (HMS). It is designed to manage the core data and business logic for a small to medium-sized medical clinic or hospital. The project's unique focus is on building a robust, self-contained database backend without a separate application layer, demonstrating a strong command of advanced SQL features for data integrity, automation, and security.

--> The database schema, business logic, and initial data are fully defined in SQL scripts, making the project easy to set up, understand, and extend. It serves as a strong portfolio piece to showcase expertise in database design, data modeling, stored procedures, functions, triggers, and views.

Key Features 
------------

--> Normalized Schema: A third-normal-form design across 15+ tables to efficiently manage patient demographics, appointments, medical records, billing, and inventory.

--> Data Integrity: Enforces data consistency and validity using a combination of PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, UNIQUE, and CHECK constraints.

--> Automated Business Logic: Uses over 10 stored procedures and functions to handle complex operations like scheduling appointments, recording medical encounters, and processing payments.

--> Trigger-Based Automation: Employs triggers to automatically manage critical tasks, such as updating medication stock levels and recalculating bill totals in real-time.

--> Role-Based Views: Provides simplified, secure data access for different user roles (e.g., receptionists, doctors) through specialized views, abstracting complex joins and sensitive information.

--> Auditing and Security: Includes a built-in AuditLog table managed by triggers to track all changes to critical data. User management and privilege scripts are included for a secure setup.
